This project takes in 4 command line inputs. They are -n <value> -s <value> -t <value> -i <value>. To run this project use the following command: ./oss -n 5 -s 2 -t 2 -i 100 
I have added a 60 second (real clock) timer for the program to terminate. The default values are -n = 5, s = 3, t = 7, i = 100. 

Problems: This project is not running with all values at 1 and i value at 100, im not sure why this is. I tried to debug it but could not find the solution.
